      <description>The Kansas City Chiefs started out fairly rough both defensively and offensively. From being at the bottom of their division and not even making the playoff picture, the Chiefs have flipped a switch halfway through the season. Week 8 against the New York Giants was the first week the Chiefs defense was able to perform relative to the expectation, or EPA.
With a 7-4 record and top of the AFC West, Chiefs fans have a more optimistic outlook on their team for the rest of the season.</description>

      <description>The Kansas City Chiefs defense has been ‘the talk’ this NFL season. Obviously, much of the talk is about their offense statistically being ranked one of the best in the league. For example, the Chiefs are ranked third in yards per offensive play. Clearly, most of us can agree that their offense is stellar, but what is going on with the defense?
With a 3-4 record so far this season, Chiefs fans are worried that their pride and joy won’t make the playoffs this year.</description>
