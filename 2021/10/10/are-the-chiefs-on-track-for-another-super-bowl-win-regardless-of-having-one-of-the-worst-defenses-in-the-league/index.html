<p>The Mahomes-era has always had a better offense than defense. But this year in particular, the Kansas City Chiefs have one of the worst defenses in the league. After week 2, the Chiefs were the worst team in their division, which happens to be the first time they are in this position since 2015.</p>
<p>The Chiefs are allowing a first down on 41.6 percent of their plays, which is slightly above the next worst, the Philadelphia Eagles with 37.6 percent. They are allowing the most yards per drive in the league, making the Chiefs on pace to be the league’s worst defense this season.</p>
<p>But back in the 2019 season, the Kansas City Chiefs defense was ranked 28th of 32 teams. Yet, they still won the Super Bowl. What does that mean for this season? Will that same trend continue? The other teams that made the playoffs in 2019 all ranked in the top 23 defensively. What’s interesting is the two teams in the Super Bowl in 2019 (Chiefs vs 49ers) were ranked the lowest defensively out of all the teams in the playoffs.</p>
